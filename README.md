# Ant Photos

An attempt to make an application similar to Google Photos, but a much inferior version, using React, Node.js and GraphQL.

This project initially started off as part of a code test for a job application, but I decided to continue working on it
to explore more of GraphQL using Apollo Server and Client, as well as Node.js libraries, like ORM (Sequelize). It is still
ongoing as of now.

Below is a complete list of technologies used for this project:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) (React UI library)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Static Site Generator (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR) React Framework)
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) (GraphQL client for React)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (Node.js web server microframework)
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) (Node.js GraphQL server)
- [Sequelize](http://sequelize.org/) (Node.js ORM library)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Relational Database)
